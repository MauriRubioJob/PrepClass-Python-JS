10. Write a Python program that accepts an integer (n) and computes the value of n+nn+nnn. Go to the editor
Sample value of n is 5
Expected Result : 615

5 + 55 + 555

int 55 -> char 5 + char 5

n -> 

char 5 + char 5 -> char 55 -> int 55

12. Write a Python program to print the calendar of a given month and year.
Note : Use 'calendar' module. 

15. Write a Python program to get the volume of a sphere with radius 6.
# (4/3) pi r^3

16. Write a Python program to get the difference between a given number and 17,
if the number is greater than 17 return double the value in positive.

17-6 = 11

17-23 = -6 -> 6 -> 12
23-17 = 6 -> 12


18. Write a Python program to calculate the sum of three given numbers, 
if the values are equal then return three times of their sum.

21. Write a Python program to find whether a given number (accept from the user) 
is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.
Note : Use the % operator which gives you the remainder of a division

22. Write a Python program to count the number 4 in a given list. 
Sample list you can use:  Lista = [2,1,34,4,4,5,6,43,45,2,24,3,4,4,324,53,4]

24. Write a Python program to test whether a passed letter is a vowel or not.

28. Write a Python program to print all even numbers from a given numbers list in the 
same order and stop the printing if any numbers that come after 237 in the sequence.
Sample numbers list :

numbers = 
[386, 462, 47, 418, 907, 344, 236, 375, 823, 566, 597, 978, 328, 615, 953, 345, 
399, 162, 758, 219, 918, 237, 412, 566, 826, 248, 866, 950, 626, 949, 687, 217, 
815, 67, 104, 58, 512, 24, 892, 894, 767, 553, 81, 379, 843, 831, 445, 742, 717, 
958,743, 527]
